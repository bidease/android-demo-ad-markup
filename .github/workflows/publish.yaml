        # gradle.properties is listed in .gitignore (intentionally — it holds local sdk paths
        # on developer machines). Writing to ~/.gradle/gradle.properties instead reaches the
        # build daemon without touching the repo or fighting .gitignore.
        # Gradle merges ~/.gradle/gradle.properties with the project-level file at startup.
        #
        # Why these values:
        #   jvmargs -Xmx5g : D8 dex workers run inside the daemon (NoIsolationWorkerFactory)
        #                    and share its heap. The Bidease SDK + 3 adapters produce a large
        #                    dex set. 4 GB OOM'd; 5 GB leaves ~2 GB headroom on the 7 GB runner.
        #   parallel=false  : Single-module project — no cross-module benefit. Disabling it
        #                    prevents AGP from scheduling dex tasks concurrently and spiking heap.
        #   workers.max=2   : Caps in-process worker threads at the runner's vCPU count.
        #   caching=true    : After the first cold build, task outputs are reused and most
        #                    tasks become UP-TO-DATE (near-instant subsequent runs).
